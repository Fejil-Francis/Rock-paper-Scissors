# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Python)

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python where the user plays against the computer. It uses Python’s random module to pick the computer’s move.
---

## 📌 How It Works

- The computer randomly chooses one of the following: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The `random` module is used to make the computer's choice unpredictable each time.
- The user is prompted to enter their choice.
- The program compares both choices and prints who wins, or if it’s a draw.
- Any other input is treated as invalid.
